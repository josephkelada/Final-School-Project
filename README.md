# Final-School-Project


So This is my take on a basic School System that can be used at a Highschool or Cegep Or even a relatively smaller University with a bit more work.

this application is a unique take on the Schools we have today, it is more student oriented meaning students can make class and course change requests and require admission to approve it.
Currently that is the only way for a student to modify his curriculum.
Logins are the Following :

Admin : Username = 20 , Password = 123

Parent : Username = 21 , Password = 123

Student : Username = 16 , Password = 123

Teacher : Username = 5 , Password = 123


All of the tasks of a specific user are shown in the application.

To Create An Account , Administration Needs to already Have you in the system and give you a User ID to which you then set a password using it.

If you are a Dev and want to be able to access logins of different accounts quicker Follow these simple steps Below :

-Open Main.Java
-Put in Comments "//" line 241 to 245
-save and run 

now you can login to different users in the same session

to open the project simply import the entire project as a directory in the file tab at the top right of Eclipse
